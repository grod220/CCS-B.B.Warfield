      Gathering every Sunday forms the heart of our ministry. Itâ€™s the time we
      meet as a family, fellowship, worship, and savor the truth of God. Our
      purpose is to glorify God.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 3pm every Sunday, it is fika time (Swedish coffee break). Coffee and
      tea are hot and ready to be poured. We take that time to greet one another
      and share about the latest in our lives. Time to visit and talk. We
      glorify God through fellowship. After this we shift our focus to worship,
      teaching, and prayer.
